Raspberry Pi Overview

The Raspberry Pi is a small computer used primarily as a compute engine, often in "headless mode" without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse.
It is designed for interfacing with the physical world, making it suitable for embedded systems.
Course Structure and Focus

The course will cover various disciplines, including Linux operating system, electronics theory, and Python programming.
It is part of a specialization that includes deeper dives into hardware, Internet communications, and security practices.
Raspberry Pi Versions

The course will primarily use the Raspberry Pi 4, but most content is compatible with older versions dating back to 2012.
A trivia note mentions the copyright dates on the Raspberry Pi's silkscreen, which can help identify the version's release year.
