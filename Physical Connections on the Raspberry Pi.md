Overview of Raspberry Pi Ports

The Raspberry Pi 4 includes standard ports like Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2, USB 3, and two HDMI ports capable of driving 4K displays.
The power supply connection is now USB-C, requiring 5 volts and up to 3 amps, unlike previous models that used micro-USB.
Specialized Connectors

The Raspberry Pi has MIPI connectors for cameras and displays, allowing for compact device integration.
Power over Ethernet (PoE) pins can send power to connected devices, such as cameras, through the Ethernet cable.
40-Pin Header and GPIO

The 40-pin header is crucial for connecting various hardware components, allowing for general-purpose input/output (GPIO) operations.
GPIO pins can output high (3.3 volts) or low (0 volts) signals, enabling control of devices like LEDs.
Advanced Features

Some GPIO pins support pulse width modulation (PWM) for controlling the brightness of LEDs and other timing-sensitive operations.
Communication protocols like SPI and I²C are available for high-speed serial communication with additional components.
