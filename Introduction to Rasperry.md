Raspberry Pi Overview

The Raspberry Pi is a small computer used primarily as a compute engine, often in "headless mode" without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse.
It is designed for interfacing with the physical world, making it suitable for embedded systems.
Course Structure and Focus

The course will cover various disciplines, including Linux operating system, electronics theory, and Python programming.
It is part of a specialization that includes deeper dives into hardware, Internet communications, and security practices.
Raspberry Pi Versions

The course will primarily use the Raspberry Pi 4, but most content is compatible with older versions dating back to 2012.
A trivia note mentions the copyright dates on the Raspberry Pi's silkscreen, which can help identify the version's release year.
Comparison of Raspberry Pi and Arduino

Hardware Differences: Raspberry Pi is a full computer with Ethernet, HDMI, USB ports, and more, while Arduino is a simpler machine with limited memory and processing speed.
Software Operation: Raspberry Pi runs a Linux operating system, allowing for multitasking but with uncertain execution timing. Arduino runs programs directly on its core, providing precise control over timing.
Applications and Use Cases

Raspberry Pi: Best for complex tasks, asynchronous computing, and internet applications due to its powerful hardware and software capabilities.
Arduino: Ideal for simple tasks requiring precise timing, such as motor control and sensor data processing.
Complementary Use

Often, Raspberry Pi and Arduino are used together, with Raspberry Pi handling complex operations and Arduino managing precise timing tasks. This combination enhances project capabilities, especially in IoT and robotics.
